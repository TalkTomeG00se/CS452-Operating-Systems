## Project 1 - Mergesort

* Author: Colten Davis
* Class: CS452/CS552 [Operating Systems] Section #num

## Overview
This project aimed to convert a non-threaded version of mergesort into a threaded version.
We used the pthread library to change a pre-existing mergesort function to run using multiple
threads. 

## Manifest
Makefile - The makefile for the project
lab.c - contains the functions for mergesort
lab.h - header file with function prototypes and defined varibles
mytests.c - driver code to run mergesort. Functions as driver and testing file
README - this file describing the project
runval.sh - memory leak testing script

## Building the project
Using the makefile, running this program is easy.
1. run 'make'
2. This will generate a runable 'mytests'
3. Usage for 'mytests' is $ mytests <input size> <number of threads> <seed>
    - Input size is number of items to sort
    - Number of threads: Default is 1, max is 10
    - Seed - seed value. Default 1, or will match thread value
4. To clean up all files, run: make clean

## Features and usage

Summarize the main features of your program. It is also appropriate to
instruct the user how to use your program.

## Testing

This section should detail how you tested your code. Simply stating "I ran
it a few times and it seems to work" is not sufficient. Your testing needs to
be detailed here.

## Known Bugs

List known bugs that you weren't able to fix (or ran out of time to fix).

## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?
