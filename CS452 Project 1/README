## Project 1 - Mergesort

* Author: Colten Davis
* Class: CS452/CS552 [Operating Systems] Section 001

## Overview
This project aimed to convert a non-threaded version of mergesort into a threaded version.
We used the pthread library to change a pre-existing mergesort function to run using multiple
threads. 

## Manifest
Makefile - The makefile for the project
lab.c - contains the functions for mergesort
lab.h - header file with function prototypes and defined varibles
mytests.c - driver code to run mergesort. Functions as driver and testing file
README - this file describing the project
runval.sh - memory leak testing script

## Building the project
Using the makefile, running this program is easy.
1. run 'make'
2. This will generate a runable 'mytests'
3. Usage for 'mytests' is $ mytests <input size> <number of threads> <seed>
    - Input size is number of items to sort
    - Number of threads: Default is 1, max is 10
    - Seed - seed value. Default 1, or will match thread value
4. To clean up all files, run: make clean

## Features and usage

Summarize the main features of your program. It is also appropriate to
instruct the user how to use your program.

## Testing

In order to ensure no memory leaks occurred, runval.sh was run, which showed 0 errors and 0 leaks.
Also, mytests was run to check for sorting time. Per project instructions, our n value was 100,000,000 for 
testing. I ensured that my implementation gained at least 2x performance, when it comes to my threaded version 
vs the single threaded version orginally gave to us.

## Reflection and Self Assessment

I haven't written in C for a long time. I relied heavily on my Google skills to help me understand how to get
threads to work for this project. My solution is the result of bits and pieces of code here and there, adapting it to
this design and project specs. 

I initially had several errors after running make. Most were due to writing 'for' loops like this: for(int i = 0)...
I did not know you can't just initialize inside the for loop; you have to declare variable 'i' by itself before the loop.
I also struggled with the concept of void pointers, which was an idea that I used from my sources below. Pointers in general 
confuse me, but a void pointer was worse. I had the '*' in the wrong spot a few times, and honestly it was trial and error
to get it right. Lastly, I thought I could break down the bulk of the main function into seprate functions, such as createThreads, 
mergeThreads, joinThreads etc. However, I couldn't figure out how to properly pass the arguments in, so I just stuck it all inside
the main function body.
